# What is generative Art ?
* Generative art refers to art that in whole or in part has been created with the use of an autonomous system. An autonomous system in this context is generally one that is non-human and can independently determine features of an artwork that would otherwise require decisions made directly by the artist.

# How it all started ?

* For this project, I started from the @Tee Kay [Swirl Music Player](https://pastebin.com/vTvvemtV).



# How to run and view it ?

* This video was made with code, using processing (Java) only. It is for the final project of Multimedia.

You can download the code and run it using Processing 3, you however need the Minim Sound Libary added to make this work.
